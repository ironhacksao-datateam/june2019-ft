# Week 0 | Extra Challenges

The students who have finished their prework before June 24th or the students who are still working at their prework but have finished the activities planned for the day are invited to complete the challenges below.

Keep in mind that the challenges are meant to be challenging! They'll help you to have a deeper understanding of the concepts learned during the prework. **Feeling stuck?** Don't forget the 4 steps discussed of how you can ask for help.

Day | Challenge
:---:| ---
Day 1 | Correlation Isn't Causation
Day 2 | Learn Git Branching
Day 3 | TBD
Day 4 | Descriptive Statistics with Python
Day 5 | Create Slides on Jupyter Notebook
Day 5 | Create Your Own Python Module

### Correlation Isn't Causation

Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation? Do you know why this difference is important? In this challenge, we invite you to deep dive into the concept of spurious correlations.

An spurious correlation occurs when two or more variables are statistically related (i. e., the fluctuation of one variable is strongly predictable by the fluctuation of another), but they aren't really related. It may happen due to coincidence or due to an unseen factor, i. e., another variable that causes the correlation.

Below, there's an example of spurious correlation taken from [this website](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) created by Tyler Vigen as a personal project.

In the graphic above, we see that there's a strong correlation between the divorce rate in Maine and the per capita consumption of margarine. In fact, the website states that the correlation between those two variables is 99.26%. That's a lot!

**Important Remark:** It's very hard to differ an spurious correlation from a valid one. We are not going to discuss it in this challenge, but one of the data-driven methodologies to evaluate the correlation between variables is to calculate the autocorrelation between the residuals of the analysis. In Statistics, residuals are the differences between the observed and the predicted values of the dataset.

In this challenge, you must:

1. Write a brief explanation of what's correlation and what's causation and the difference between those two concepts;
2. Select a spurious correlation on the website linked above and create a theory to explain why this correlation happens;
3. Discover two new spurious correlations using [this tool](https://tylervigen.com/discover). Please, be creative and only consider correlations stronger than 60%.
4. Now, you have to create a theory to debate why the variables in the correlations you've selected on step 3 aren't related.
5. Create a report with all your findings and explanations and email it to your Teaching Assistants.

### Learn Git Branching

Have you already forked a repo or two but want to learn more? The difference between git merge and git rebase makes you shake? We invite you to try an amazing interactive [website](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) created by [Peter Cottle](https://github.com/pcottle) that teaches you how to be a real Git hero.

In this challenge, you must **complete all the exercises** of the Main and the Remote tabs of the levels window.
