Therefore, we can either trust the weight and height columns or the DOB column. Since there are other columns that indicate that these are adults (they have emails, some have diabetes) we will drop the `patient_dob` column. We will also drop the `appointment_date` column since it has too many unique values to transform to a dummy variable. Drop the two columns in the cell below."
